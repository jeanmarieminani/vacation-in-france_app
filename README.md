### Pushing the Docker Image to GitHub

Sharing the Docker image itself on GitHub directly is not necessary since Docker images are typically stored on Docker Hub. However, you can include the link to your Docker Hub image in your `README.md` file as shown above.

By following these steps, you'll be able to share your project and Docker image information on GitHub effectively. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
