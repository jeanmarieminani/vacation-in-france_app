**1. Description**
The main purpose of this project is to build a Holiday_FastAPI. we  developed two apps: vacation-in-france and and holiday-route-app
The vacation-in-france_app: Focuses on fetching attractions and "things to do" based on user context
The holiday_route_app: handles route planning and user statistics
Our containers adopted isolation and scalability principles, if one app fails it wonâ€™t affect the other
